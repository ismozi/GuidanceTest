###INSTRUCTION
An AI chatbot needs to query a database in order to obtain a notion of chronology of events which will help it respond to the user's last message.
This database contains past and future events objects, which are characterized by a "date and time" attribute.
Given the CONVERSATION WINDOW, determine multi days period to search for in your memory, so that you can have the necessary context to respond to the user's last message.
