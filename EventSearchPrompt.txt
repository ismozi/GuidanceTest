###INSTRUCTION
An AI chatbot needs to query a database in order to obtain a notion of chronology of events which will help it respond to the user's last message.
This database contains past and future events objects, which are characterized by an "event descripton".
Given the CONVERSATION WINDOWs, determine the event descriptons to search for.
